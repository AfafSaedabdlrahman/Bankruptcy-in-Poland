In this project, I worked with financial data from the Emerging Markets Information Service. You'll look at financial indicators from Poland and Taiwan, and build a model that predicts bankruptcy.
Here are some of the new skills i've learned:
* Navigate a file system using the command line
* Load and save files using Python
* Work with imbalanced data using resampling
* Build ensemble models like random forest and gradient boosting trees
* Evaluate a classification model using precision and recall
